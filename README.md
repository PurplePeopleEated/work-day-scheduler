# Work-Day Scheduler

## Description

This application is a work-day time-management tool. Loading the page will display the current date. Below that, the user is provided a space in each hour of the typical work-day to type in tasks. The background of each hour block changes depending on the time of day you load the page to display past, present, and future in a visual manner, and any data saved is saved in localStorage.

Below is a screenshot of the website and a link to it.

## Usage

When the page loads, choose a time block to update with tasks. Typed-in tasks can be saved by clicking the save button of the task that was updated. These tasks will persist upon reloading the page so you don't lose anything!
